The fact they were introduced together is the biggest facet of your theory. The idea that Oda was originally going to have One Pieceâ€™s same ending way earlier has clued us into so much. Just like Viviâ€™s importance to the story and the introduction of ancient weapons, this couldâ€™ve been very intentional.

Why would Luffy want this?  Multiple times in the series he has no problem when he is about to die. Also doesn't want to become someone important? Sorry man this doesn't makes sense.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 3 hours ago (11 children)
Luffy is the type to accept his fate. No matter what, Luffy dying shuts down any dream, including his goal to become king of the pirates. 
Luffy specifically doesn't want to be a hero.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 3 hours ago (2 children)
Also, he literally wants to be king of the pirates. That's pretty damn important if you ask me lol.

[â€“] BFBooger Bounty Hunter [score hidden] 2 hours ago (1 child)
Not important if you ask Luffy.   His own quotes about what it means for him to be pirate king don't have anything to do with being 'important'.
Honestly, this is one of the flattest theories I've read in a while.   It focuses on this one panel, ignores the MC's personality, and ignores all the other important hints.
Like the context of when Luffy / Roger share their dream; in both cases this dream doesn't fit at all IMO.
These two aren't self-centered, self-important people.   Their dream would NEVER revolve around a greedy desire to be remembered.  That is the sort of dream that mass murderers and villains have.
Oda would never have Luffy's dream be so self-important

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 2 hours ago (0 children)
Luffy is a very selfish character. He always has been throughout the entire series.
As for importance, I agree. I don't think they find it "important". I'm just saying the role of Pirate King is an important one, whether Luffy likes it or not. It was just a counter argument to Luffy not wanting to be important, I agree.

[â€“] vygemici1 [score hidden] 3 hours ago (7 children)
No no Luffy specifically doesn't want to become someone important. He said that to the alliance. Also what I meant by saying he's okay with dying is that he doesn't seem to have longing for a long life just a full one. Of course him dying also shuts down becoming king of the pirates but the difference is when someone says that they want to become the pirate king Luffy gets angry and more serious he is not accepting that but when someone says Im going to kill you and stuff like that he doesn't seems to be affected or triggered like being pirate king. He goes like ok if you kill me, you kill me, Im not afraid of that.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 2 hours ago (5 children)
I do find this to be a contradictory aspect of Luffys character. He literally wants to be the most important person in the whole world

[â€“] vygemici1 [score hidden] 2 hours ago (0 children)
For you being pirate king means becoming the most important person in the world. Luffy thinks that pirate king is the most free man in the world. He doesn't want fame, importance or money. He wants to be free and have a good adventure. Becoming pirate king accomplishes both of them.

[â€“] BFBooger Bounty Hunter [score hidden] 2 hours ago (1 child)
He wants to be the most free person in the world, not most important.   PK isn't most important.  Luffy doesn't see it that way at all.   He sees it as someone with the most freedom and the least responsibility.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 2 hours ago (0 children)
It's not exclusive. 
Being free does not mean you're not important. Also, the concept of my theory is more about being remembered forever. That's not a responsibility.

[â€“] sebzelda [score hidden] 1 hour ago (1 child)
He doesn't. His definition of "Pirate King" is different than other people's definition. His definition is "the most free person in the whole world." Him wanting to be Pirate King has nothing to do with him wanting other people to think of him as important.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 1 hour ago (0 children)
It doesn't really matter. Achieving Pirate King is a big deal regardless.
Luffy doesn't care he's a Yonkou, but it's certainly shaken up the world.
Regardless, this conversation doesn't fall in line with my theory, its off topic

[â€“] sebzelda [score hidden] 1 hour ago (0 children)
Luffy doesn't care about death or dying as long as he does in persuit of his dream, as to him it's a dream worth dying for. He wants to achieve his dream but he's happy even in death because at least he died trying.
Same reason Roger was happy with his death. He didn't complete his dream, but he died fighting to make it a reality.

What I think what Roger meant with "I will not die, partner", is that his will would get past on and his dream will be inherited, but that he didn't achieve his dream.
Edit: love this theory btw. It would fit perfectly for their characters. Only problem I have is the part where Luffy needs to become Pirate King first. He could also achieve that dream without becoming Pirate King too.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] 6 points 7 points 8 points 5 hours ago (3 children)

Brook is not immortal, the Yomi Yomi no mi simply resurrects you after death, and it doesn't give you eternal life. Brook will pass away one day, either of old age or something else.
Literally, the obly reason Brook is a skeleton is because his soul got lost in the florian triangle, trying to get back to his body for too long that his corpse has already decomposed.

[â€“] ahhdamnsmitt [ S ] [score hidden] 4 hours ago (2 children)

Luffy being 'remembered' in Hiluluk's way, has always been a byproduct of Luffy being Luffy. It never has been Luffy's goal or even a conscious thought. Quite the opposite.

Honestly though, I kinda hope we are all wrong and Oda has something else up his sleeve.

This would also be another clue that luffy dies at the end.

No I'd don't think so. 
When luffy lost gear 5 temporarily while fighting kaido, kaido told him
"Die in peace. The story of the battle you guys fought will be passed down by someone."
I really love luffy's answer on that.
"I... don't need that... After you die, all that left is bones... But it's not over yet. We can't put end to it yet, right? Momo! Tama! 
Kin'emon! Pedro! "
