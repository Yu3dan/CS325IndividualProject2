The arc we are introduced to Hiriluk is the same arc we learn of the Will of D.

 Yea. The only reaction that doesn't fit that great is sanji's for this. Cause sanji would understand where he is coming from and not say his head needs check. He may still laugh but he wouldn't think luffy has brain damage lol. Unless luffy said it in a stupid way...so maybe it does fit lol

 The fact they were introduced together is the biggest facet of your theory. The idea that Oda was originally going to have One Piece’s same ending way earlier has clued us into so much. Just like Vivi’s importance to the story and the introduction of ancient weapons, this could’ve been very intentional.

 Why would Luffy want this?  Multiple times in the series he has no problem when he is about to die. Also doesn't want to become someone important? Sorry man this doesn't makes sense.

 Luffy is the type to accept his fate. No matter what, Luffy dying shuts down any dream, including his goal to become king of the pirates. 
Luffy specifically doesn't want to be a hero.

 Not important if you ask Luffy.   His own quotes about what it means for him to be pirate king don't have anything to do with being 'important'.
</p>

<p>
 Honestly, this is one of the flattest theories I've read in a while.   It focuses on this one panel, ignores the MC's personality, and ignores all the other important hints.
</p>

<p>
 Like the context of when Luffy / Roger share their dream; in both cases this dream doesn't fit at all IMO.
</p>

<p>
 These two aren't self-centered, self-important people.   Their dream would NEVER revolve around a greedy desire to be remembered.  That is the sort of dream that mass murderers and villains have.
</p>

<p>
 Oda would never have Luffy's dream be so self-important

 Luffy is a very selfish character. He always has been throughout the entire series.
As for importance, I agree. I don't think they find it "important". I'm just saying the role of Pirate King is an important one, whether Luffy likes it or not. It was just a counter argument to Luffy not wanting to be important, I agree.

 No no Luffy specifically doesn't want to become someone important. He said that to the alliance. Also what I meant by saying he's okay with dying is that he doesn't seem to have longing for a long life just a full one. Of course him dying also shuts down becoming king of the pirates but the difference is when someone says that they want to become the pirate king Luffy gets angry and more serious he is not accepting that but when someone says Im going to kill you and stuff like that he doesn't seems to be affected or triggered like being pirate king. He goes like ok if you kill me, you kill me, Im not afraid of that.

 For you being pirate king means becoming the most important person in the world. Luffy thinks that pirate king is the most free man in the world. He doesn't want fame, importance or money. He wants to be free and have a good adventure. Becoming pirate king accomplishes both of them.

 He wants to be the most free person in the world, not most important.   PK isn't most important.  Luffy doesn't see it that way at all.   He sees it as someone with the most freedom and the least responsibility.

 It's not exclusive. 
Being free does not mean you're not important. Also, the concept of my theory is more about being remembered forever. That's not a responsibility.

 He doesn't. His definition of "Pirate King" is different than other people's definition. His definition is "the most free person in the whole world." Him wanting to be Pirate King has nothing to do with him wanting other people to think of him as important.

 It doesn't really matter. Achieving Pirate King is a big deal regardless.
Luffy doesn't care he's a Yonkou, but it's certainly shaken up the world.

<p>
 Regardless, this conversation doesn't fall in line with my theory, its off topic

 Luffy doesn't care about death or dying as long as he does in persuit of his dream, as to him it's a dream worth dying for. He wants to achieve his dream but he's happy even in death because at least he died trying.
</p>

<p>
 Same reason Roger was happy with his death. He didn't complete his dream, but he died fighting to make it a reality.

 What I think what Roger meant with "I will not die, partner", is that his will would get past on and his dream will be inherited, but that he didn't achieve his dream.
</p>

<p>
 Edit: love this theory btw. It would fit perfectly for their characters. Only problem I have is the part where Luffy needs to become Pirate King first. He could also achieve that dream without becoming Pirate King too.

 I think his dream and Luffy's dream directly tie into the theme of enherited will. That's why I added the connection.
Thanks for the love :D

 Headcanon: Luffy wants to blast his jolly roger into the surface of the moon, where it will (more or less) never fade or be forgotten. Like the US planting a flag, but more permanent.

 Brook is not immortal, the Yomi Yomi no mi simply resurrects you after death, and it doesn't give you eternal life. Brook will pass away one day, either of old age or something else.
</p>

<p>
 Literally, the obly reason Brook is a skeleton is because his soul got lost in the florian triangle, trying to get back to his body for too long that his corpse has already decomposed.

 I don't know about that. I think he's at the point where he can die only if he's killed. He literally has no organs, old age wouldn't be a thing.

 Yeah there's no such things as dying of "old age" one of your organs failed. Like you said he literally has no organs. I honestly see Brook going on forever with Laboon and his eventually descendants on Reverse Mountain giving shows  and telling stories to the pirates headed into the Grand Line.

 Why would Luffy need to become pirate king to make that possible?
</p>

<p>
 Caring about being remembered is also opposite of Luffy, to the point that his lack of need for being validated is even a running gag.

 I'm saying why would Luffy 'want' to live forever? His goals have never been about making a statement or being well known etc etc, to the point it is always pointed out that he doesn't care about how people perceive him.
</p>

<p>
 Luffy being 'remembered' in Hiluluk's way, has always been a byproduct of Luffy being Luffy. It never has been Luffy's goal or even a conscious thought. Quite the opposite.

 Well maybe you are indeed right. No one knows for sure. My discussion is also kind of me trying to find out what my own thoughts are.
</p>

<p>
 Some of the theories I like at the moment are Luffy's dream being a giant banquet, involving the whole world, everyone to become a pirate (or 'freeing' the whole world), or opening up the whole world and all seas (all blue).
</p>

<p>
 Honestly though, I kinda hope we are all wrong and Oda has something else up his sleeve.

 You just said he wasn't, though. Lmao.

 He wasn't there yet. He even told Dalton that "his foolish son" would soon be there and to not hurt him.

 During his famous words, he was nearby. Once Hiriluk blew up, he was standing there. He could have heard his last words.

 This is all about inherited Will. A grand death that allows you to live forever. Something Kaidou yearned for. Dying to laid would've left him as just bones. Its not living forever the way Luffy dreams.

 Interesting theory. I’m really looking forward to when Oda finally reveals what Luffy’s dream is

 This would also be another clue that luffy dies at the end. Someone mentioned in another thread that Luffy is shaving years of his life quick (for multiple reasons during different times in the series) - so him becoming King of the Pirates then (probably) destroying the red line and THEN dying - he will be remembered forever.

 No I'd don't think so. 
When luffy lost gear 5 temporarily while fighting kaido, kaido told him
"Die in peace. The story of the battle you guys fought will be passed down by someone."
I really love luffy's answer on that.
</p>

<p>
 "I... don't need that... After you die, all that left is bones... But it's not over yet. We can't put end to it yet, right? Momo! Tama! 
Kin'emon! Pedro! "
</p>

<p>
 Another person is Oden who said similar thing. 
" I don't mind... Being forgotten! But... My spirit will live on!"

 This is why I point out Roger. He did not care about dying, but what did he tell Rayleigh? He will not die.
We also need to find out what he told Shanks, I think that is key.

 Why would they act like that was impossible? remembering someone forever is totally doable. That's how history works. We'd never be around to know if these things are forgotten, so it's virtually forever. "Living forever" if that's how Luffy worded it would be way more shocking.

 Maybe. I personally like I want to live forever because it sounds more rediculous and childish. Remembered forever wouldn't justify the responses.

 I would agree with this. But wasn’t luffy present for doffy’s explanation of the OP OP fruit wouldn’t that make luffy have a reaction to that.

 I think Luffy's dream is to be remembered forever, but because he's silly Luffy he just words it as "live forever"

 I still think it’s going to the moon on the sunny. That seems like a dream Roger would have had. We saw in louge town Roger initial dream was to visit every island on the grand line. So it would make sense if he then wanted to go to the moon.

 I used to think so, but I just don't think his dream is a plot related one. I think it's a dream to hammer home the series philosophy of enherited will and the will of D.

 Could be to become Pirate King and have everyone in the world be part of his crew, at which point they'll have a giant feast to celebrate it

 I think it aligns with both Luffy's personality and Nika in that we have seen great peace and prosperity come from territory being claimed by powerful pirates (like Fishmen Island and the Whitebeards) so Luffy becoming Pirate King and claiming everything as his territory and letting everyone live free seems consistent

 Luffy tells Kaido that he isn't interested in their battle being written because "once you're dead, all that's left is bones" so i believe this is unlikely.
